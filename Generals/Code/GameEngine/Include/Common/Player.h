/**
	A "Player" as an entity that contains the persistent info of the Player, as well as containing 
	transient mission data.

	Some of the Player's attributes persist between missions, whereas others are "transient" and only 
	have meaning in a mission, wherein they change a lot (current tech tree state, current buildings 
	built, units trained, money, etc). (For clarity of nomenclature, we'll refer to all "persistent"
	vs "non-persistent" attributes, since "transient" has an unclear duration.)

	A "Player" consists of an entity controlling a single set of units in a mission. 
	A Player may be human or computer controlled. 

	All Players have a (transient) "Player Index" associated which allows us to do some shorthand for
	representing Players in some cases (mainly in bitfields). This is always a 0-based
	number (-1 is used as an illegal index). Note that a logical conclusion of this
	is that it makes it desirable to limit the maximum number of simultaneous Players
	to 32, but that seems quite reasonable.

	All persistent data associated with the Player will be saved to local storage and/or 
	synchronized with one of our servers for online play. 

	Note, simple accessor methods are omitted for brevity... for now, you may infer
	them from the data structures.

	Note also that the class (and the relevant subclasses) are almost certainly incomplete;
	a short perusal of the RA2 equivalent class(es) have waaay more tweaky data fields,
	some of which will probably be necessary (in some form, at some point), some of
	which won't ever be necessary. Rather than trying to guess at all of them here,
	we're limiting the initial setup to be the almost-certainly-necessary, filling in
	the extra things as needed. (Note that most of these will be non-persistent!)
