//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//	WWSaveLoad
//
// The WWSaveLoad library is a framework for saving and loading.  The main
// goals that we attempted to achieve in designing this system are:
// 
// - Save things in a form that could adapt as our code evolves.  We want
//   to be able to load files which were created with a previous version of the 
//   application into the current version.
// - Use the same framework throughout all of our libraries with as small an
//   impact on them as possible
// - Automate as much of the implementation of save-load as possible.
// - Make this a generic hunk of code which contains no commando-specific parts
//   so that it can be used by other applications.
// - Make this system capable of generating the file formats for our level editor,
//   the game's level definition file, and player save files.
//
// To achive this, we developed several core concepts:
//
// - Persistant Objects: Most of the state of the game is contained in the objects
//   active at any given time.  PersistClass is an abstract interface which will allow
//   objects to be used with the save-load system.  It was also important to keep the
//   overhead caused by inheriting this class to an absolute minimum.
// 
// - PersistFactories: We need an automatic "virtual-constructor" or "abstract-factory" 
//   system for all objects that get saved.  This is the PersistFactoryClass and the 
//   automated SimplePersistFactory template.  All objects that "persist" are derived from 
//   PersistClass and all concrete derived PersistClasses have an associated static
//   instance of a PersistFactory which handles their saving and construction upon encountering
//   them while loading.  In certain cases these PersistFactories can also serve as
//   a "shortcut" where we cheat by not actually telling the object to save but simply save
//   a small piece of data that allows us to recreate an identical object when we load.  This
//   is used in WW3D sometimes; we just save a render object name and then ask the WW3D asset
//   manager to recreate that model for us.
//
// - SaveLoadSubSystems: The overall file structure will be governed by many sub-systems 
//   (derived from SaveLoadSubSystemClass).  The application in-effect creates file formats 
//   by simply having the sub-systems that it wants write into a file.  In this way you can
//   achieve things like saving only static data into one file and dynamic into another, etc.
//   All persistant objects that get saved will be told to save by some sub-system.  For
//   example: in Commando, I have a PhysicsDynamicDataSubSystem which saves all of the 
//   dynamic physics objects.  In saving those objects I use the built-in PersistFactories
//   and am therefore completely safe from new object types being added to the system, it will just
//   automatically work
//
// - Pointer re-mapping: A pointer remaping system is built into the save-load system.  There
//   are several things that happen in this system.  Each object, as it is saved and loaded, 
//   registers with the system its old address and its new address.  (the old address is saved
//   and the new address is available once the object is created).   This is automated by the
//   SimplePersistFactory for all but classes that use multiple inheritance.  During the load
//   process a table is built which contains all of these pointer pairs (old address, new address).
//   Whenever an object loads a pointer, it gives a "pointer to that pointer" to the save load system.
//   Then, after all of the objects have been loaded, the system goes through that list of pointers
//   and finds them in the pointer pair table.  NOTE: use the macros for re-mapping your
//   pointers to enable automatic debugging information when you build with WWDEBUG defined.
//
// - Chunks: The file format will be chunk based since that gives us the flexibility to
//   add new data and remove obsolete data without necessarily losing the ability
//   to read old files.  We will use a "high-granularity" of chunks.  In many cases, each 
//   member variable will be in its own chunk for maximum flexibility.  To help soften
//   the memory usage for this approach, we developed the concept of "micro-chunks".
//   Micro-chunks are just like chunks in that they have an id and a size but
//   each of these fields are only a single byte and they are never hierarchical.
//
// - ChunkID's: The chunk ID's used by Subsystems and PersistFactories must be unique
//   but all others can be considered local to the object that is saving itself.  Unique
//   ids for the subsystems and factories are achieved by saveloadids.h defining ranges 
//   of ids for various libraries and then those libraries maintaining a single header 
//   file internally which gives unique id's within that range to all of their sub-systems 
//   and persist factories.  Never re-use an id or you will break compatibility with older 
//   versions of your files...
